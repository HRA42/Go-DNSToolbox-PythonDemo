# DNS-Toolbox Demo

This is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of DNS-Toolbox. The App is designed to allow for DNS queries to be made like MXToolbox.com. It can help you solve DNS problems, find out about your DNS records, and more. Another Demo will focus around the check of SSL certificates.
